To add textures to text, convert your text layer to a Smart Object first by right clicking 
the layer and choosing “Convert to Smart Object.” You are limited to layer effects by

designing for the screen. Converting to Smart Objects allows you to apply filters and 
other techniques to the text while preserving your editing capabilities in the event you 
need to change what the text says later.
